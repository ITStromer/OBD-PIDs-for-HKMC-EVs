# OBD PIDs for the Hyundai Kona EV and Kia Niro EV

## How to use:

These codes are primarily for use with Torque Pro which runs on Android phones and tablets. The preferred method of inputting them to the phone is via the plugin, HKMC-EV-Torque-Plugin.
Or this can be done manually. [Setting up Torque to show OBD data](https://jejusoul.github.io/OBD-PIDs-for-HKMC-EVs/)

## TODO:
Most of the PIDs from the Kia Soul EV are working for Ioniq and Niro. Some values are based on Soul EV and need to be adjusted to the Niro specs.
